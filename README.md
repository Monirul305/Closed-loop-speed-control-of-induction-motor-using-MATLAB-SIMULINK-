# Closed-loop-speed-control-of-induction-motor-using-MATLAB-SIMULINK

This project proposes a closed loop speed control of induction motor where the 
speed control is based on V/F control with the help of SVPWM (Space Vector Pulse Width 
Modulation) method. The whole thing is illustrated in SIMULINK which is a design integration 
of MATLAB.
